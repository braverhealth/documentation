# Compatibility

### Mobile Device

* Minimum **iOS** / **iPadOS** version: **15.1**
* Minimum **Android** version: **7.0**

<details>

<summary>Using in "remotely managed" mode</summary>

If you are a healthcare organization and want to distribute Braver to patients or caregivers on mobile devices that you own, you have the option to use Braver in [**remotely managed** mode](../for-administrators/remotely-managed-mobile-device.md).

In this mode:

* The user will not be able to accidentally log out of their account (which will reduce support needs for your teams)
* The user will not have to enter their PIN to unlock the Braver app (only possible if a PIN or biometric recognition is enabled on the mobile device)

For this mode, only iOS and iPadOS are supported, and we recommend **at minimum** the following devices for their increased security:

* iPhone XS and XS Max
* iPad Air 3
* iPad mini 5
* 8th generation iPad

</details>

### Web Browser

* **Google Chrome** or **Microsoft Edge**: minimum version **120.0**
* **Apple Safari**: minimum version **16.0**
