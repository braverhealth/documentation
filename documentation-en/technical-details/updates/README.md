# Updates

Since Braver is a cloud platform distributed on the web and via App Store (iOS and iPadOS) and Play Store (Android) application stores, we distribute updates automatically to all our users at the same time, as soon as our quality control process is completed.

In order to be notified in advance of updates, for example to prepare if it is relevant to you, we offer email notifications.

You can decide to subscribe to our update mailing list or [unsubscribe at any time](#user-content-fn-1)[^1], all on your own.

Updates that represent both important new features and minor improvements will always be published on the [version tracking page](https://app.gitbook.com/o/zMIZEnF83uQLxLHiNR0f/s/57ZaWz2PEvUFxecHed5o/).

### Update Frequency

* **In the case of important new features**, we will send an email notification and a [version tracking](https://app.gitbook.com/s/57ZaWz2PEvUFxecHed5o/) article at least four (4) weeks in advance, referring to one or more publicly accessible guides. This will allow you to communicate relevant changes to your team as needed.
* **In the case of minor application improvements**, we will send an email notification and a [version tracking](https://app.gitbook.com/s/57ZaWz2PEvUFxecHed5o/) article at least one (1) week in advance, referring _if relevant_ to one or more publicly accessible guides. This will allow you to communicate relevant changes to your team as needed.
* **In the case of bug fixes**, we will send an email notification as soon as the update is published and available to users.

[^1]: Unsubscription is done through the same form as registration.
