# Account Creation

**There are several ways to create your Braver account**

1. If you use Braver integrated into another software (e.g., Leomed or Gustav), your account will be created the first time you activate the Braver bubble in that software. Here is [how it works](https://support-en.braver.net/guides/for-professionals/creation-de-compte/activation-dun-compte-par-la-bulle-integree).
2. If you accept an invitation to join Braver for the first time, whether by an invitation from your healthcare organization or by an invitation from a colleague in the network, your account creation will be done by following the steps presented to you. Here is [how it works](https://support-en.braver.net/guides/for-professionals/creation-de-compte/accepter-une-invitation).
3. If you create an account completely independently, you will be asked to provide some information about yourself, and then you will be asked to prove your right to practice. Here are [the steps to follow](https://support-en.braver.net/guides/for-professionals/creation-de-compte/creation-de-compte-autonome).

Even if you create your account independently (**option 3**), you can reuse this account if you are later invited to join a healthcare organization (**option 2**) or if you start using Braver integrated into another software (**option 1**).

In these situations, you will just need to choose the **Use an existing account** option that will be offered to you.

If you later wish to delete your account, you can do so easily [in a few simple steps](https://support-en.braver.net/guides/for-professionals/securite/supprimer-un-compte-braver). **But be careful**! Account deletion is irreversible!
