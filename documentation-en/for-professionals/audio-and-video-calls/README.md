In Braver, you can easily call your contacts in a discussion thread (here is [how](https://support-en.braver.net/guides/for-professionals/audio-video-calls/start-and-leave-call)) or from the profile of a friend in your network.

These contacts can include patients or caregivers, as well as professional colleagues or members of your organization.

When a call is initiated, the other users invited to the call will see their mobile device ring like a phone call and can answer with or without the camera activated (see [how](https://support-en.braver.net/guides/for-professionals/audio-video-calls/join-and-leave-call)).

When you are in a call from the web application, you can set a background image and share your screen if needed.

**Feel free to consult** [**our dedicated guides**](https://support-en.braver.net/guides/for-professionals/audio-video-calls) **to quickly understand how to use audio and video calls.**
