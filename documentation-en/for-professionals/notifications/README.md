# Notification Control

Notifications in a communication tool like Braver are crucial. Missed notifications can negatively impact the quality of care, and too many unnecessary notifications lead to fatigue and desensitization of the healthcare worker. The right balance is necessary!

In Braver, you have several tools to help you avoid being overloaded with notifications and to indicate to your colleagues when you are available.

### Availability Schedules

When you set an availability schedule in Braver and a colleague tries to reach you outside of this schedule, they see a yellow dot next to your name, indicating that you might not respond.

The availability schedule means that you will be available to collaborate during a defined period, so your contacts will know they just have to wait until you are available again.

The availability schedule follows a defined recurrence to minimize the configuration needed on your part.

### Unavailability Periods

When you set an unavailability period and a colleague tries to reach you during this period, they see a red dot next to your name, indicating that you are unavailable until a certain date and time in the future.
