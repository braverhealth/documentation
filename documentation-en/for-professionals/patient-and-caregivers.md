# Communication with Patients and Caregivers

A healthcare professional or an organization can invite the patient or external collaborators who are not part of the Braver network but are still involved with the patient (e.g., parents, caregivers) to communicate and exchange information.

1. A patient or caregiver is always invited from one or more [patient files](patient-files.md)
2. To communicate with them, [care channels](care-channels.md) are created, specifically inviting them
3. These care channels gather all the information exchanged with the patient and their caregivers in a way that distinguishes them from other interprofessional exchange channels, helping to avoid errors
