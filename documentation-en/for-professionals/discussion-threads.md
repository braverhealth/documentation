# Discussion Threads

All information exchanges on the platform are done through discussion threads (and through [direct messages with friends](https://support-en.braver.net/for-professionals/reseau#vos-amis), but these are not covered on this page).

Discussion threads can include messages (text, voice, and video), files (photos, videos, or documents). A thread can be closed when it is considered finished, making it immutable.

**Feel free to consult** [**our dedicated guides**](https://support-en.braver.net/guides/for-professionals/discussion-threads) **to quickly understand how to use discussion threads.**

### Accepting and Declining

When you are invited to a discussion thread by a colleague outside your organization, you will have the option to **accept** or **decline** the discussion. If you decline, the discussion thread will disappear completely and cannot be retrieved. The sender will also see that you have declined.

If you accept the discussion thread, you can start exchanging messages or content.

You can later leave the discussion thread when you consider it appropriate, which will make it disappear from your [active threads](discussion-threads.md#fils-actifs). However, it will still be accessible in relevant places (e.g., colleague's profile, patient file, etc.).

## Types of Discussion Threads

### Clinical Discussion Threads

A clinical discussion thread is **linked to a patient**. It is a discussion you can have with a person or a team.

You can start a clinical discussion thread in a **care channel** or **outside a channel**. [Care channels](care-channels.md) help you group discussion threads under the same theme and automatically add the required people to the discussion.

### Non-Clinical Discussion Threads

A non-clinical discussion thread **is not linked to a patient**. It is a discussion you can have with a person or a team.

If the discussion evolves and you see that it would be better to associate it with a patient, it is possible to do so.

## How to Find Them?

### Active Threads

The **Active Threads** tab in the **Home** tab shows you all the discussion threads where you are active and that are not closed. This includes both clinical and non-clinical discussion threads.

Thus, if you leave a discussion thread or if it closes, it will disappear from this list.

If someone writes something you haven't seen yet and the discussion closes immediately after, you will still see it in this list to allow you to see the message you haven't seen yet. After that, it will disappear from this list.

### Discussion Threads Linked to Network Contacts

If you navigate to the profile of a colleague with whom you have had discussions (here's [how](https://support-en.braver.net/guides/for-professionals/reseau/consulter-le-profil-des-utilisateurs-sur-le-reseau)), you will find the list of discussion threads where you and this colleague have participated, which will include all the history of clinical and non-clinical threads, open or closed.

### Discussion Threads Linked to Patient Files

If you navigate to a [patient file](patient-files.md), you will find among other things the entire history of discussion threads attached to it, open or closed.

Clinical discussion threads concerning patients can also be found in care channels. In these cases, you will find them by navigating in the care channel.
