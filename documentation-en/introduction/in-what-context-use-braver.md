# In what context can it be used?

Braver is a clinical communication tool adapted to the healthcare field, but transversal to the entire ecosystem, meaning it can be used in hospitals, in the community, or in private settings. Here are some examples of use cases:

* Home hospitalization trajectory or remote follow-up (e.g., post-surgery)
* Intra-hospital interprofessional communication
* Coordination of care teams in long-term care or intra-hospital to improve hospital flow
* Virtual meetings with the patient and/or caregiver
* Information exchange with patients, families, and/or caregivers
* Communication between GMF (Family Medicine Groups) professionals and community organizations
