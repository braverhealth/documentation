# Who can join Braver?

## Healthcare Professionals

### Independent Participation

The Braver platform offers a unique network for all healthcare professionals. They can become members of the Braver network independently, meaning it is not necessary for the organization they work for to be a member of the network.

### Detailed Profile

Each healthcare professional can create their own detailed profile, which will allow them to be visible on the network and thus be able to be contacted by other professionals. The detailed profile presents the professional's occupation, degrees, specific skills, workplace, and contact information.

## Healthcare Organizations

Organizations in the Braver network can include any entity that:

* Requires the sharing or centralization of information from a common patient database
* Groups more than one healthcare network professional, who can display their affiliation with it
* Can be authorized to confirm that a member is indeed a qualified healthcare professional
* Includes among its members staff who are not healthcare professionals

**A Braver user can be a member of one or more distinct organizations.** Thus, an administrative member of an organization invites other Braver members to join the organization, and they receive one or more applicable roles.

{% hint style="warning" %}
A Braver user who is a member of multiple organizations can only have one active organizational context at a time.

Thus, the channels or patient files they have access to at any given time are always those of a single organization at a time, and the identification of this active organization is visually evident in the application.
{% endhint %}

A Braver user may not be a healthcare professional if they are explicitly invited into a [care channel](../for-professionals/care-channels.md) or an organization.
