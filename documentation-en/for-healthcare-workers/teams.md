# Teams

When creating a discussion thread, you can include individuals and **teams**. Proper configuration of teams allows Braver to notify the right people at the right time.

**Feel free to consult** [**our dedicated guides**](https://support-en.braver.net/guides/for-healthcare-workers/equipes) **to quickly understand how to use teams.**

* If you include teams without identifying who in the team you want to talk to, the discussion thread ends up in the team's [triage box](teams.md#la-boite-de-triage).
* If you include an individual who is a member of a team, their team is also added to the discussion thread, and the invited person can invite other members of their team to join the discussion thread as needed.
* These teams are made up of members who share communication management.
* A workplace can gather different teams.
* Team grouping is mostly based on **professions** (e.g., "nursing" gathers all the nurses on a floor, "physiotherapy" gathers all the physiotherapists in a clinic, etc.), but administrators can use any basis to build a team.

## Your Role in the Team

### Team Manager

If you are a team manager, you have access to all discussions involving the team, even if another member of your team participated in the discussion.

As a team manager, you will be able to add yourself to any team discussion thread, assign another team member as needed, and remove the team from a discussion thread.

You will also have access to your team's [triage box](teams.md#la-boite-de-triage) and will be notified (according to your availability schedule) when a new discussion is deposited there.

It is quite common for a team to consist only of managers, especially if all members are interchangeable in their roles.

### Team Participant

If you are a participant rather than a manager, you will only have access to the team's discussion threads in which you have been assigned or added.

You will still be able to invite another colleague from your team to a discussion thread, for example, to replace you or to ask for their opinion.

## The Triage Box

When a team receives a message, the team members who have the role of [manager](teams.md#gestionnaire-dequipe) can participate in the discussion, include other participants, and even assign a responsible person.
