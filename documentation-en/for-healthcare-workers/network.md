# The Network

In the Network tab of Braver, you will find **your** network. This network is **yours**, meaning you are the only one who can see what you add to it, and it allows you to easily access the people or teams you work with most frequently, so you can quickly communicate with them.

**Feel free to consult** [**our dedicated guides**](https://support-en.braver.net/guides/for-healthcare-workers/reseau) **to quickly understand how to use the network.**

<details>

<summary>The <strong>network</strong> in a few lines</summary>

* Braver allows healthcare professionals to collaborate with all the actors surrounding their patients, whether they work in the same organization or not. Braver enables validated healthcare professionals to find other healthcare professionals working in different organizations: this is called the **Braver Network**.
* The **Internal Network** includes all members of the same organization who exchange on Braver. For example, by clicking on a workplace, you can see all the members of the internal network of a healthcare establishment.

<summary>The <strong>directory</strong> in a few lines</summary>

* In the Network tab of Braver, you can find all members of the internal or external network of your workplace in the search bar.
* If you frequently communicate with a healthcare professional, it is a good practice to add them to your directory. Adding them to discussion threads will be faster as they will be suggested immediately.
* When you add a professional to your directory, they are not notified.
  * Here is [how to add people to your directory](https://support-en.braver.net/guides/for-healthcare-workers/reseau/ajouter-un-contact-a-votre-bottin). Adding workplaces works the same way.
* If you invite a colleague to be a **friend**, they will also be added to your directory immediately and will be notified of this request.

### Searching the Network

To add workplaces and people to your network, you must first find them.

The search tool at the top of the page allows you to find other employees of your organization, as well as other healthcare professionals and workplaces in the Braver Network.

{% hint style="warning" %}
To find healthcare professionals outside your organization, you must have a validated profession.

Your profession can be validated in two ways:

* Another Braver user with a validated profession invites you to the network. Here is [how to accept an invitation](https://support-en.braver.net/guides/for-healthcare-workers/creation-de-compte/accepter-une-invitation) and [how to send one](https://support-en.braver.net/guides/for-healthcare-workers/reseau/inviter-un-professionnel-de-la-sante-a-rejoindre-le-reseau-braver).
* You add a profession to your profile and provide proof to the Braver verification team. Here is [how to add a profession to your profile](https://support-en.braver.net/guides/for-healthcare-workers/gestion-du-profil/ajouter-sa-profession).
{% endhint %}

Once you have found the people or workplaces you want to keep handy, click the **Add to my directory!** button.

<details>

<summary>The <strong>profile</strong> in a few lines</summary>

* When a colleague finds you in the Braver directory or clicks on your name in a care channel, they can view your profile.
* Your profile includes your photograph, a space to describe yourself, your profession, and your workplace(s).
* It allows you to ensure that you are talking to the right person and to learn more about them.

* You have access to a private place to chat with this person, called **direct messages**. No one else but you and your friend can access the information exchanged there.
* If you share your phone number in your profile, your friend can call you directly with one click.
