# Patient Files

To view, create, or modify patient files, you can use the "Patients" tab.

1. The **With active threads** filter shows you the patients for whom there are currently ongoing threads that concern them. If you are part of a team and have the permissions to see the discussions that other team members have regarding patients in your organization, you will also see these patients here.
2. The **Where I participate** filter is only visible if you are part of a team and have the permissions to see the discussions that other team members have regarding patients in your organization. It serves to show only the patients for whom there are discussion threads or care channels where you have been personally involved.
3. The button to create a new patient file is located at the bottom right.
4. The search bar allows you to find patient files that you have created or that have been created in your organizational unit (if you are part of an organization).

<details>

<summary>The <strong>patient files</strong> in a few lines</summary>

* Patient files allow identifying the patients about whom you collaborate. All clinical discussion threads about this patient will be recorded in this location.
* Each independent professional or organization can create patient files and collaborate with other stakeholders using these files as anchors.
* These files collect all exchanged information as well as the consents obtained from patients to carry out these exchanges within secure channels.
* To preserve confidentiality, the patient files held by professionals or organizations are not themselves shared during collaboration with other stakeholders. However, nominative information is indeed shared to simplify the process. Each person has their own file and thus their own perspective of the patient's information, to the extent of what they can access.
* The patient files of an organization can be aligned and/or synchronized with a centralized patient index to ensure continuity of information and proper referencing.
