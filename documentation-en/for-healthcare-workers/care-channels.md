# Care Channels

Care channels are secure spaces shared between multiple parties (healthcare professionals, [teams](teams.md), and possibly the [patient or their caregivers](patient-and-caregivers.md)) where participants can create discussion threads and upload documents, multimedia files, and forms.

**Feel free to consult** [**our dedicated guides**](https://support-en.braver.net/guides/for-healthcare-workers/care-channels) **to quickly understand how to use care channels.**

<summary>Care channels in a few lines</summary>

* A care channel groups a "care team" where discussions occur. Thus, discussion threads can be classified in a patient file and then in a specific care channel.
* Care channels allow reaching the entire care team with a single click, without having to add all participants one by one.
  * For example, under a patient's file, you might find the "Prescriptions" care channel that includes the doctor, nurse, and pharmacist of the patient. All discussions about prescriptions will be grouped in this care channel.
* Discussions created in a channel can include all members of the care team or a subset of it. This allows notifying the right people without disturbing others while ensuring they still have access to the shared information.
* Communication with a patient or a member of their entourage is done by inviting them into a care channel.

* A care channel is always associated with a patient file.
* These channels are titled to offer an immediately recognizable context for the care team members (e.g., "Comfort Care", "Chronic Back Pain", "Multidisciplinary Care", "Hospitalization", etc.).
* A member of the patient's care team who created or was invited to a care channel (e.g., their family doctor, pharmacist, home care nurse) can easily initiate discussion threads with one or more other care team members as needed.
* The team of a care channel can include:
  * individual healthcare providers
  * the [patient or members of the patient's entourage](patient-and-caregivers.md) (e.g., family, caregiver)
  * [teams](teams.md)
* When a work team is invited to a care channel, one of its members can be designated as the person responsible for the patient at a specific time.
* The designated member of a work team for a particular care channel can change over time, either manually or through integration with a source system for schedule management (on-call person) or patient records (person responsible for the patient).
* Discussions created in a channel can include all members of the care team or a subset of it.
* The care team gathered in such a channel can be composed of members from the same organization or different organizations, as they are all within a single network.
  * When the patient's consent is implicit between the different parties (e.g., different teams within a hospital), consent is not requested as it is not necessary.
  * When a user or team is invited to a care channel but there is no implicit patient consent between the inviting party and the invited party, Braver requests and records that the inviting person has obtained the patient's consent to include the other party in the care channel.
* A care channel can be created automatically through integration with a third-party system, for example, following an event that requires information exchange between designated professionals.
* When invited to be included in a care channel, the invitee can choose to accept or decline the invitation, except for patients or caregivers.
