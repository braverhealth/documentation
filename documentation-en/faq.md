# Frequently Asked Questions

## Account

<details>

<summary>How do I create an account?</summary>

If you are a healthcare professional, you can download the application directly from the app stores (App Store or Play Store) and proceed to create your profile. You will then need to be validated by the Braver team by providing your practice number and proof of identity.

After being validated, you can use the free basic version of Braver to collaborate securely! To fulfill its mission of enabling healthcare professionals to take a step towards change, it is essential for Braver that the network is inclusive.

<details>

<summary>Why do I need to be invited? How can I get invited?</summary>

Braver is a network of verified healthcare professionals. To be eligible for the network, you must be invited by a professional already validated on the network who can validate you in turn.

If you do not know anyone on the network who can invite you, Braver can proceed with a manual validation and verification process.

## Security

<details>

<summary>How is Braver more secure than emails or texts?</summary>

Braver is an end-to-end encrypted messaging service, meaning that each message you send can only be decrypted by you and your recipients. Emails cannot achieve the same level of security. Even if you maximize the protection of your email management system, you cannot guarantee that your recipients have done the same. Additionally, emails can always be forwarded to unauthorized parties without leaving any trace.

Braver's cybersecurity has also undergone an audit process by the Ministry of Health and Social Services, which allowed it to obtain the TGV certification.

<summary>Is it possible to leave a trace of communications made in Braver directly in the patient record software I use? Can I export communications about a patient?</summary>

Braver protects exchanged data but does not want to hold it hostage! We collaborate with various electronic health record partners to integrate with them and offer you the most pleasant communication experience possible.

<summary>Can I set myself as unavailable to avoid receiving notifications outside of work hours?</summary>

Yes, Braver aims to protect the balance between your professional and personal life.

You can [configure your work hours](https://support-en.braver.net/guides/for-healthcare-workers/gestion-des-notifications/regler-son-horaire-de-disponibilites) to only receive notifications when you are working.

If you are absent, you can use the [“Unavailability Period” feature](https://support-en.braver.net/guides/for-healthcare-workers/gestion-des-notifications/regler-sa-periode-dindisponibilite) which clearly indicates your absence and your return date to your collaborators.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Can I find healthcare professionals outside my workplace?</summary>

Braver allows you to create your own network of collaborators, but you can also find any professional present on the Braver network who wishes to be visible.

You can also search by workplace if that is useful to you; a workplace groups all members of a healthcare organization, accessible with a single click!

</details>

<details>

<summary>Which networks can be used for communication?</summary>

Braver works well when you are connected to a Wi-Fi network, cellular Internet network (3G, LTE, 5G), but not telephone networks and Bluetooth.

In these situations, what you share will be temporarily stored and sent when you are connected again to one of the supported networks.
