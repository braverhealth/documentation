# Workplaces

## What is a workplace?

A **workplace** represents a physical location where practitioners work.

Workplaces on the Braver Network allow users to find the right people or the right teams of professionals to communicate with them using discussion threads or care channels.

Users will automatically see in their Network the workplaces they are associated with, making it easy to find their colleagues.

It is also possible to [add workplaces to your organization's directories](../directories.md) to facilitate access to additional resources for your organization's members.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
A medical clinic has at least one workplace linked to its main address. If it is multi-site, it can be configured to have multiple workplaces, each associated with the relevant practitioners.
