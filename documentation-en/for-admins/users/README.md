# Users

A user can be invited into an organization as a [**professional**](./#professional-user), [**administrative**](./#administrative-user) user, or both.

{% hint style="info" %}
We do not refer to a patient or caregiver user as a user who is part of an organization.

This type of user only receives limited access to certain care channels. They do not appear anywhere else as users who can receive additional access from the organization.
{% endhint %}

Adding a user to an organization is done by inviting them into an [organizational unit](../organizational-units/).

The first time they are invited in this manner into a given organization, they receive an email inviting them to accept the invitation (possibly by completing the creation of their account). If, subsequently, they are invited into another unit of the same organization, they will not need to do anything and will not receive an email invitation.

### Professional User

A user is considered "professional" if they have access to the Braver communication application to interact with other users using discussion threads and care channels.

To have this type of access on behalf of the organization, the user in question must be part of at least [one team](../teams/) as a participant or team manager.

### Administrative User

A user is considered **administrative** (or simply an **administrator**) if they have access to the administrative console.

To have this type of access for a given organization, the user in question must have the _Admin_ role for at least one of the organization's [organizational units](../organizational-units/).
