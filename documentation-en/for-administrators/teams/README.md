# Teams

## What is a team?

A team groups users whose responsibilities are similar. A team can be invited to participate in a discussion thread, and in doing so, the right person or people from that team can intervene in the discussion, pass the baton to another team member, or withdraw.

For example, a **emergency doctor team** could be created in a given hospital, allowing another staff member to address the responsible emergency doctor for a certain patient.

And when the emergency doctor in question finishes their shift, they can invite their replacement to take over without the interlocutor having to do anything, allowing seamless continuity.
{% endhint %}

#### Triage box

A team can also have a triage box, which allows inviting the team into a discussion thread without knowing exactly who should intervene. The triage box also allows a team member to withdraw from a discussion by sending the discussion back to triage so that another member can take over.

## Do I really need to create separate teams?

Even if several members with distinct responsibilities (e.g., a clinical nurse and a doctor) generally need to share the same information, it is still strongly recommended **not to group them** into the same team.

The product is designed to optimize the routing of notifications so that, for example, a message that should notify the nurse should not notify the doctor.

Rather than putting people with different responsibilities in the same teams, it is recommended to get into the habit of explicitly inviting other relevant people into the discussions where they are required, or to use care channels when there are recurring needs for inter-team sharing.
