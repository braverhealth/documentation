# Leomed

<div align="left"><figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/CleanShot 2025-01-09 at 22.34.16.gif" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure></div>

### Advantages of Leomed and Braver Integration

* No need to duplicate access management to Braver for Leomed users. **Access is automatically granted based on your Gustav configuration.**
* Team, workplace, and patient index management is completely automated
* Healthcare staff can remain in Leomed and still be notified of important messages or calls from Braver, and call the patient or caregiver as needed
* Automated tasks sent to patients and caregivers can be securely transmitted through Braver's patient and caregiver portal!
