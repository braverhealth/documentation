# Deploy Braver via Gustav

{% hint style="info" %}
The process usually involves creating a pre-production environment and then creating a second production environment. The first step is required only once, as we will use the same information.

**The other two steps will need to be repeated for both environments.**
{% endhint %}

### Here are the steps to configure your organization in Braver

{% stepper %}
{% step %}
**Share your organization's information with the Braver team**

We will be automatically notified of your submission of this information and will contact you for the next steps.

{% hint style="info" %}
The information submitted through this form is kept confidential and is only shared internally with authorized personnel.
{% endhint %}

{% embed url="https://braverhealth.typeform.com/to/oCwOkEZl" %}
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
**Group the professions you have in Gustav by team**

We will send you a document to fill out that will allow us to associate the different professions configured in Gustav with dedicated teams in Braver.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
**Grant access to Braver module from Gustav**

{% hint style="warning" %}
Before proceeding with this step, you must wait for a member of the Gustav or Braver team to confirm that the integration is functional.
{% endhint %}

You must grant access to the "Braver" module to the relevant profiles. **Refer to Gustav's documentation to do this.**
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
**Access the administrative application**

{% hint style="warning" %}
Subsequently, if you have not yet created your account, you should have received an email invitation. Here is [the tutorial](../../for-professionals/account-creation/independent-account-creation.md) to help you create your account.
{% endhint %}

You can access the administrative application via [https://admin.braver.net](https://admin.braver.net/#/login). Use the same information you use to log into your Braver account (email + password)
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
**Grant the "Admin" role to the right people**

Here is how to [grant a role to an existing user](../../for-administrators/users/how-to-grant-role-to-existing-user.md).

{% hint style="info" %}
When activating Braver user accounts, the Gustav platform provides Braver with all roles and permissions except the Admin role. This role must therefore be manually granted in the Braver administrative application.

The Admin role gives a user permission to log into the administrative application and thus create workplaces, teams, and invite users. However, since you are using Braver via an integration with Gustav, all these actions are facilitated for you, as they are automatically completed through the integration between the two platforms.
{% endhint %}

The most useful functionality in the Braver administrative application will be **the audit log**. Here is [the tutorial](../../for-administrators/audit-logs/how-to-search-in-audit-logs.md) showing how to search in the audit log.
{% endstep %}
{% endstepper %}

{% hint style="info" %}
For patient and caregiver invitation, this will be done via Gustav. A tutorial will follow soon.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="success" %}
**Congratulations, your organization is now part of the Braver network!** ðŸŽ‰

Only two sections remain to be explored:

* [Patient and Caregiver Module](../../for-administrators/configuration-guide/)
* [Other Technical Details](../../for-administrators/configuration-guide/)
