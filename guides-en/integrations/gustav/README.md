### Advantages of Gustav and Braver Integration

* No need to duplicate Braver access management for Gustav users. **Access is automatically granted based on your Gustav configuration.**
* Team, workplace, and patient index management is fully automated
* Healthcare staff can stay in Gustav and still be notified of important messages or calls from Braver
