### Here are the steps to set up your organization in Braver:

{% step %}
#### Define Your Organization Structure

If you are using Braver independently and are not sure about the best structure for your organization, let us help you.

Here is a concrete example of a healthcare organization structure:

{% endstep %}

{% step %}
#### Submit an Organization Creation Request

1. Share your organization's name with the Braver team using the following form
2. Wait for a Braver team member to contact you for the next steps

{% endstep %}

{% step %}
#### Access the Administrative Application

{% hint style="warning" %}
If you have not yet created your account, you should have received an email invitation. Here is [the tutorial](../../for-professionals/account-creation/independent-account-creation.md) to help you create your account.
{% endhint %}

You can access the administrative application via [https://admin.braver.net](https://admin.braver.net/#/login). Use the same credentials as those for logging into your Braver account (email + password)
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
#### Create Your Organizational Units

Here is [how to create an organizational unit](../organizational-units/how-to-create-organizational-unit.md).

If you are not familiar with the concept of organizational unit, here is [the documentation](../organizational-units/).
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
#### Create Your Workplaces

Here is [how to create a workplace](../workplaces/how-to-create-workplace.md).

If you are not familiar with the concept of workplace, here is [the documentation](../lieux-de-travail/).
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
#### Create Your Teams

Here is [how to create a team](../teams/how-to-create-team.md).

If you are not familiar with the concept of team, here is [the documentation](../equipes/).
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
#### Send User Invitations

Before sending user invitations, it is very important to understand what roles and permissions you will grant them. Here is [the documentation](https://app.gitbook.com/s/C7asQvRtcnnGS2hUcyO0/pour-les-administrateurs/utilisateurs/roles-et-permissions) to help you.

You are now ready to send user invitations. Here is [how to invite a user](../utilisateurs/comment-inviter-des-utilisateurs.md).

{% hint style="info" %}
For inviting patients and caregivers, this is done by authorized clinicians through the clinician application. Here is [a tutorial](../../pour-les-professionnels/communication-patients-et-proche-aidants/inviter-un-patient-ou-un-proche-aidant-a-rejoindre-braver.md) to guide you.
{% endhint %}
{% endstep %}
