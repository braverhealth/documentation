# View Team Threads

{% hint style="info" %}
The _Team Threads_ tab groups all discussion threads of your team, active or not.

With _Team Threads_, it is possible to access all messages shared between all members of your team, whether you participated in the discussion thread or not.

It then becomes easy to join a discussion belonging to your team, if needed.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="warning" %}
If you are not part of a team, or if you do not have the required permissions to view this tab, you will not have the option to access this page.

**Also, it is important to note that Braver logs access to these** _**Team Threads**_**.**  Authorized persons in your organization can therefore produce access audits as needed.
