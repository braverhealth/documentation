**Using your mobile device, scan this QR code.**

You will be asked to install the application, and then you will have access to your session without logging in. The QR code will give you direct access to your session.

If needed, you can quickly install the application by going to our [download page](https://www.braver.net/en/download/) before scanning the QR code.
