# Accept Invitation

## Step by Step

{% stepper %}
{% step %}
#### In the email you received, click on the button inviting you to accept the invitation.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
#### One of the following screens might be displayed

*   If this is the first time you are opening Braver, and Braver has never been opened on your device, you will see a screen like the following:

    <div align="left"><figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/creation-de-compte-via-une-invitation - Option 2.png" alt="" width="375"><figcaption></figcaption></figure></div>

    \
    You can then choose the "Create a new account" option to continue to [step 3](accept-invitation.md#follow-account-creation-steps), unless you have already created a Braver account in the past (in which case you should choose the other option, and you will directly go to [step 4](accept-invitation.md#enter-invitation-secret-code-or-answer-secret-question)).
*   If this is the first time you are opening Braver, but Braver has already been used by someone else on your device, you will see a screen like the following:

    <div align="left"><figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/creation-de-compte-via-une-invitation - Option 1.png" alt="" width="375"><figcaption></figcaption></figure></div>

    \
    You can then choose the "Create a new account" option to continue to [step 3](accept-invitation.md#follow-account-creation-steps), unless you have already created a Braver account in the past (in which case you should choose one of the other options, and you will directly go to [step 4](accept-invitation.md#enter-invitation-secret-code-or-answer-secret-question)).
*   If you have already created your account in the past with the same email address as the invitation, but your session is not already active on your device, you will see a screen like the following:

    <div align="left"><figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/creation-de-compte-via-une-invitation - Option 3.png" alt="" width="375"><figcaption></figcaption></figure></div>

    \
    In this case, you should enter your password and in the next step, the security code you will receive by email or SMS, in order to proceed to [step 4](accept-invitation.md#enter-invitation-secret-code-or-answer-secret-question).
*   If you have already created your account in the past with the same email address as the invitation, and your session is already active on your device, you will see a screen like the following:

    <div align="left"><figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/creation-de-compte-via-une-invitation - Option 4.png" alt="" width="375"><figcaption></figcaption></figure></div>

    \
    In this case, you should simply enter your PIN to proceed to [step 4](accept-invitation.md#enter-invitation-secret-code-or-answer-secret-question).

#### Follow the account creation steps

{% hint style="info" %}
This step is only necessary if this is the first time you are using Braver.
{% endhint %}

You can [follow the tutorial](independent-account-creation.md#enter-your-email-address-and-password-of-your-choice-then-select-create-my-account) for this purpose.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
#### Enter the invitation secret code or answer the secret question

{% hint style="info" %}
Depending on how the invitation was secured, you will either need to **answer a security question** or **enter a 12-digit secret code** (e.g., 1234-1234-1234).

If it asks for a secret code, you will find it **under the invitation button** in the invitation email you clicked on in [step 1](accept-invitation.md#in-the-email-you-received-click-on-the-button-inviting-you-to-accept-the-invitation).
